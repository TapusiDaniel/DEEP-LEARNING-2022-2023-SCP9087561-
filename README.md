In this homework, we explored Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), implementing a custom VAE model in PyTorch. The primary goal was to learn the latent space representation of the MNIST dataset using both the reconstruction loss and the Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KL-Divergence). We also experimented with generating new samples from the learned latent space and visualized the results.

### Key tasks:
  1. **VAE Architecture**:

     * Introduced a Sampling layer using the reparameterization trick, which allows the VAE to generate samples from the learned latent space
     * Created the encoder to output the mean and log-variance for the latent space, and implemented the sampling function to draw latent space values
  2. **Loss Functions**:
     * Defined the two main losses for the VAE:
        * **Reconstruction loss**: Ensured the decoded samples matched the original inputs using binary cross-entropy
        * **KL-Divergence**: Regularized the latent space by comparing the learned distribution to a standard normal distribution
     * Implemented the KL-Divergence loss from scratch within the VAE model
  3. **Training Loop**:
     * Designed a training loop combining the reconstruction loss and KL-Divergence loss, with a tunable beta parameter to control the relative importance of each loss
     * Set the latent dimension to 2 for easy graphical representation of the learned latent space

     * Experimented with different layer sizes, activation functions, and learning rates to optimize the modelâ€™s performance
  5. **Generation of New Samples**:
     * Generated new images by sampling random values from the 2D latent space and feeding them into the decoder
     * Visualized the reconstructed images and observed the smooth transition between different digits in the latent space, which demonstrates how the VAE learns a meaningful representation
  6. **Visualization of Latent Space**:
     * Plotted the distribution of digit encodings in the 2D latent space, showing how the VAE clusters similar digits together (e.g., 8 and 9)
     * Explored the impact of different latent space values on the quality of the reconstructed images
  7. **Hyperparameter Exploration**:
     * Experimented with the number of layers and units, observing that reducing the model complexity resulted in poorer reconstructions, while increasing complexity led to overfitting
     * Compared activation functions like ReLU and leaky ReLU, finding no significant difference in performance for this dataset due to the absence of negative pixel values
